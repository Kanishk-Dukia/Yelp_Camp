Express-Node-Mongo Web App
This repository contains a web application built using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. It provides a basic structure for developing a web application that interacts with a MongoDB database.

Prerequisites
To run this web application, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org
MongoDB: You can download and install MongoDB from the official website: https://www.mongodb.com
Getting Started
To get started with the web application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-node-mongo-webapp.git
Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd express-node-mongo-webapp
Install the dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
npm install
Start the MongoDB server on your local machine. You can do this by running the mongod command in your terminal or using a MongoDB GUI tool.

Create a .env file in the project root directory and provide the following configuration details:

plaintext
Copy code
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/webapp
Make sure to replace mongodb://localhost:27017/webapp with the appropriate MongoDB connection URI for your setup.

Run the application using the following command:

sql
Copy code
npm start
The application will start running on http://localhost:3000.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

app.js: The main application file that initializes and configures the Express.js server.
routes/: This directory contains the route definitions for the different endpoints of the application.
models/: This directory contains the MongoDB data models for the application.
controllers/: This directory contains the logic for handling requests and responses.
views/: This directory contains the views/templates for rendering dynamic content.
public/: This directory contains static files such as stylesheets and client-side JavaScript files.
middlewares/: This directory contains custom middleware functions.
utils/: This directory contains utility functions that can be used throughout the application.
config/: This directory contains configuration files, such as database configuration.
Feel free to modify the project structure according to your needs.
